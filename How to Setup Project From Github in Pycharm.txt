> How to Setup Project From Github in Pycharm
----PUJAN PATEL-----------


1) Update the project
   - First select the master branch from top (you can do by select the master and then select checkout)
   - then update Project option will update the latest files from master branch

2) Install packages
   - Like we did in mini project,install django,djangorestframework,django-cors-headers,npm,npm-register-cli,npm-package-validator
   
3) Run backend (must be running before proceding to frontend)
   - cd CodingDirections
   - python manage.py makemigrations
   - python manage.py migrate
   - python manage.py runserver
   
   (let the server running,dont close it)

4) Install Angular (need to do this for first time only when you import the project for first time in pycharm)
   - first install node.js (https://youtu.be/__7eOCxJyow)
   
   Do below steps in project terminal
   
   open new terminal by clicking on plus button beside existing terminal in pycharm
   - cd CodingDirections/frontend
   - Install the angular here by command : npm install -g @angular/cli
	 (https://angular.io/guide/setup-local)
   - After its build install ng using npm : npm install ng
   - after that do: ng serve
   
   Above command will build the frontend and push it to server ,so you can access frontend from that link which its provide and communicate with backend.
